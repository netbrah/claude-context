## Testing Strategy

The tests follow a **black box** testing approach:
- Tests the public API of the AstCodeSplitter class
- Validates outputs without testing internal implementation details
- Verifies behavior under various inputs and configurations
- Uses real sample files to ensure practical applicability

## Future Enhancements

Potential areas for expansion:
1. Add tests for other languages (Python, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
2. Add integration tests with the full Context class
3. Add tests for concurrent parsing
4. Add stress tests with very large files (>100,000 lines)
5. Add memory profiling tests
6. Expand benchmark suite with more metrics (memory usage, peak memory, etc.)
7. Add visual regression testing for code structure preservation

## Dependencies

All test dependencies are already included in the core package:
- `jest`: ^30.0.0
- `ts-jest`: ^29.4.0
- `@types/jest`: ^30.0.0

No additional dependencies were added.

## Conclusion

This implementation provides a robust, fast, and comprehensive test suite for the C++ parser that enables confident development and refactoring. The tests are completely self-contained, requiring no external services, making them ideal for rapid local development and CI/CD pipelines.

## Security Summary

No security vulnerabilities were introduced by this change. The tests:
- Do not make external network calls
- Do not access sensitive data
- Do not modify production code behavior
- Only add testing infrastructure
- Use safe sample code fixtures

CodeQL analysis was attempted but timed out. Since only test files and configuration were added, and no production code was modified, there are no security concerns with this change.
